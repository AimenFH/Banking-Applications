üìò CHAPTER 1 ‚Äì INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and Motivation
‚û°Ô∏è Introduce microservices and their evolution. Explain why configuration management is especially important in microservices. Share your personal/professional motivation for choosing this topic.

1.2 Problem Statement
‚û°Ô∏è Describe specific challenges with local configurations (e.g., inconsistency, secret leakage, lack of scalability). Highlight how these challenges justify your research.

1.3 Research Objectives
‚û°Ô∏è State what your thesis aims to evaluate: impact on scalability, security, and maintainability through centralized config.

1.4 Research Question
‚û°Ô∏è Clearly state the research question. Example:

How does centralized configuration management with Spring Cloud Config Server improve scalability, security, and maintainability in microservices compared to local configurations?

üìò CHAPTER 2 ‚Äì LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Overview of Microservices
‚û°Ô∏è Define microservices, explain key characteristics, benefits, and challenges. Compare with monolithic architecture.

2.2 Configuration Challenges in Microservices
‚û°Ô∏è Explain how configuration works in microservices and why it's more complex (e.g., different environments, number of services, need for consistency).

2.3 Centralized vs. Local Configuration
‚û°Ô∏è Compare both approaches:

Local: simple but not scalable

Centralized (e.g., Spring Cloud Config): scalable, versioned, but needs setup
Support with real use cases or academic comparisons.

2.4 Security and Observability Considerations
‚û°Ô∏è Discuss the importance of secure config (secrets management, access control) and tools for monitoring changes (e.g., Spring Actuator, Prometheus).

üìò CHAPTER 3 ‚Äì RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3.1 Research Design
‚û°Ô∏è Explain your experimental setup: comparing two systems ‚Äî one using local config, the other using centralized config.

3.2 Tools and Technologies
‚û°Ô∏è List and justify your tech stack:
Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Config, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Keycloak.

3.3 Evaluation Metrics
‚û°Ô∏è Define how you‚Äôll measure success in each area:

Scalability (deployment time, autoscaling)

Security (secret exposure, RBAC)

Maintainability (time to update config, rollback ease)

üìò CHAPTER 4 ‚Äì SYSTEM DESIGN
4.1 Architecture Overview
‚û°Ô∏è Show and explain system components (API Gateway, Eureka, Config Server, microservices, database).

4.2 Implementation Approach
‚û°Ô∏è Describe how you built the system, steps taken, Git structure, services implemented.

4.3 Configuration Strategy
‚û°Ô∏è Explain how Spring Cloud Config is integrated, how Git is used, what kind of config files you use (profile-based), and how you manage secrets.

üìò CHAPTER 5 ‚Äì EXPERIMENTATION & EVALUATION
5.1 Load and Scalability Testing
‚û°Ô∏è Run tests (e.g., JMeter, Locust) to compare how both systems handle load. Show CPU/memory usage, response times, scaling behavior.

5.2 Security Evaluation
‚û°Ô∏è Evaluate how each setup handles secrets, encryption, and access control (e.g., Spring Security + Keycloak).

5.3 Maintainability and Operational Effort
‚û°Ô∏è Measure the effort needed to change configs, perform rollbacks, and debug config issues in both setups.

üìò CHAPTER 6 ‚Äì RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
6.1 Summary of Findings
‚û°Ô∏è Present your data (tables, graphs). Highlight where centralized config made a difference.

6.2 Analysis and Interpretation
‚û°Ô∏è Analyze results: were expectations met? Where did centralized config help the most? Were there trade-offs?

üìò CHAPTER 7 ‚Äì CONCLUSION
7.1 Conclusion
‚û°Ô∏è Summarize the whole project. Revisit the research question and answer it based on your findings.

7.2 Recommendations and Future Work
‚û°Ô∏è Suggest improvements (e.g., GitOps, Vault integration). Mention ideas for follow-up research or real-world deployment.
